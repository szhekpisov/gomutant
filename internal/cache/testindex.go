//
// The result is always a superset of AllInDir(pkgDir): every test file in
// the mutant's own package is in the set, not just the files declaring the
// covering tests. A package-level test helper — a table builder, a custom
// assertion, a fake — lives in a _test.go file that need not declare any
// test entry point at all, so BuildTestIndex records no name for it and no
// coverage-derived name can ever resolve to it. Loosen an assertion inside
// such a helper and a KILLED mutant starts surviving while its own file,
// its package's non-test files, and the covering test's file are all
// byte-identical. Test files are deliberately outside pkg_hash (folding
// them in would invalidate test-independent NOT_VIABLE entries on every
// test edit), so tests_hash is the only dimension that can carry them, and
// it can only carry them at package granularity.
//
// testNames then adds the cross-package half: with -coverpkg (--integration)
// the covering tests can be declared outside pkgDir entirely, and those
// files gate the mutant too. Names the index doesn't know contribute
// nothing — they resolve to no file, and the local set already stands.
//
// crossPkg says whether a foreign declaring directory can be a genuine
// cross-package coverage relationship: the caller sets it when this run
// instruments beyond the package under test (--integration, or an explicit
// --coverpkg), which is what it takes for a test outside pkgDir to record
// coverage on the mutant at all. When it is set, a foreign directory
// contributes its whole package the way pkgDir does: every _test.go in it
// (the same helper-only argument as above, which applies verbatim to R's
// assertion helpers) and every non-test .go file. Under --integration the dependency arrow points
// the other way from the usual one: mutants live in target package T, the
// covering tests live in importer R, and pkg_hash only ever hashes T. R's
// helpers and fixture builders — most of what an end-to-end test is made
// of — would otherwise sit in no dimension of the key at all, so loosening
// R's fixture would replay T's mutant as KILLED after it started surviving.
// pkgDir itself is excluded from this: pkg_hash already covers the mutant's
// own package, and re-adding it here would make an unrelated production
// edit invalidate the tests dimension too.
//
// Without crossPkg the expansion is skipped and only the declaring file
// itself is added, because a foreign hit is then a name collision rather
// than a dependency. TestMap.TestsFor deliberately projects package context
// out of the covering names, so FilesFor("TestNew") resolves to every
// indexed package declaring a TestNew — and TestAdd, TestParse or TestString
// live in several packages of most repositories, this one included.
// Expanding on a collision would fold unrelated packages' production sources
// into tests_hash and make an edit anywhere in them invalidate this mutant:
// package-scoped invalidation degraded to repository-scoped by a name two
// packages happened to share. The declaring file itself is still added — it
// is one file, and it keeps the conservative direction on the off chance
// that the name really is the covering test.
//
// A nil receiver yields nil, but there is no `ti == nil` guard here: both
// lookups this delegates to are already nil-safe and return nil, so the
// loops below iterate zero times and files stays nil. An explicit guard
// would be an unobservable branch — the same reason BuildTestIndex elides
// its redundant `|| f == nil`.
