// Regression corpus for infrastructure-error classification.
//
// Real `go test` output for host failures, paired with the ground truth a
// human would assign. It exists because the classifier reads a stream with
// two authors — the Go toolchain and the code under test — and every bug
// found in it so far was a case of trusting the wrong one. A signature list
// change that looks harmless in isolation shows up here as a flipped verdict.
//
// The host-failure cases and the "a test printed it itself" cases both matter:
// missing a host failure resurrects the false KILLED that issue #79 reported,
// and matching a test's own output silently drops a genuine kill out of the
// efficacy denominator. Several cases are taken from the patch proposed on
// that issue (chrisophus/gomutants, feat/infra-error-classification), whose
// wider signature list is what surfaced the build-phase gap.
